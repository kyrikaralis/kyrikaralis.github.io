<p>My pottery is about line, form, and function.  My work is intended 
    to be used daily. I believe that using handmade objects can bring a 
    newness, a specialness, to every day rituals such as drinking your 
    morning coffee; it's this notion that keeps me interested in creating 
    functional pottery. I have sold my work through Etsy since 2007, 
    and currently I have works for sale through this website, and in 
    person at local markets. </p>



<p>About me:
    <br>
    I grew up reading and daydreaming in a sleepy Central Florida beach 
    town, and I fell in love with music theory, singing and visual art 
    in high school. I have my BFA in photography from the University of 
    North Florida in 2004. 
    <br>
    <br>
    In addition to making pottery, I take photographs, 
    knit, ride and work on bicycles, hike, SUP, practice yoga and generally 
    spend as much time outdoors as possible.</p>
